#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free
# If the user enters an age, it converts the input to an integer and checks the age to determine the ticket cost.
# - If the age is less than 3, it prints that the person is allowed to enter for free.
# - If the age is between 3 and 12 (inclusive), it prints that the ticket will cost $10.
# - For all other ages, it prints that the ticket will cost $15.
